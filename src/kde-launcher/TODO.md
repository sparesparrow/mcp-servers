# KDE Launcher MCP Server - TODO List

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Documentation and design diagram (README.md)
  - Created comprehensive README with architecture diagram, tool descriptions, and setup instructions
  
- ✅ Implementation
  - Created main server implementation with D-Bus integration
  - Implemented all core tools (search_applications, launch_application, etc.)
  - Added security measures (input validation, command sanitization)
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms for when D-Bus is unavailable
  
- ✅ Testing documentation
  - Provided manual testing instructions in TESTING.md
  - Created unit tests in tests/test_kde_launcher_server.py
  
- ✅ Dockerization
  - Created Dockerfile.kde-launcher with proper dependencies and security measures

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Integration with Claude Desktop
  - Test integration with Claude Desktop to ensure it works properly
  - Create sample prompts for testing integration
  
- [ ] Performance Optimization
  - Add caching for frequently used application searches
  - Optimize desktop file parsing for faster fallback mechanism
  
- [ ] Enhanced Features
  - Add support for Wayland in addition to X11
  - Implement tool for changing KDE desktop settings
  - Add "smart launch" feature to find and launch apps with similar names
  
- [ ] Additional Testing
  - Create integration tests with real KDE environment
  - Test behavior across different KDE Plasma versions
  - Add load testing for multiple concurrent requests
  
- [ ] Documentation Improvements
  - Add diagrams showing D-Bus communication flow
  - Create video demonstration of server capabilities
  - Document common error scenarios and their solutions

## Known Issues

1. D-Bus API may differ between KDE Plasma versions, requiring version-specific adapters
2. Window management is more limited in Wayland compared to X11
3. Desktop file parsing is basic and could miss some applications or details
4. Needs appropriate environment variables when run in Docker to access X11/Wayland

## Future Ideas

1. Create a web-based UI for testing the KDE Launcher MCP server
2. Implement activity and virtual desktop awareness
3. Add support for KDE Connect to extend functionality to mobile devices
4. Create a higher-level orchestrator that combines desktop control with other MCP services
